\section{Framework Design}
\label{sec:design}

We start by laying out the involved parties and their respective trust
assumptions (\S~\ref{sec:trust-assumptions}), followed by an overview of our
system (\S~\ref{sec:overview}).  We then discuss the two major aspects of our
framework: the build system (\S~\ref{sec:build-system}) and the framework
(\S~\ref{sec:framework}).

\subsection{Trust Assumptions}
\label{sec:trust-assumptions}

Our setting has four participants that have the following trust assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \emph{service provider} wants to process sensitive client
      information.

    \item The \emph{client} is a user of the service provider.  It does not
      trust the service provider and wants verifiable guarantees that the
      service provider will never see the client's sensitive information in
      plain text.  Clients further have an incentive to commit fraud and lie
      about their IP addresses.

    \item The \emph{infrastructure provider} is a third party that provides
      infrastructure to the service provider.  The client trusts that the
      infrastructure provider and the service provider don't collude.

    \item The \emph{enclave provider} makes available enclaves to the service
      provider.  Both the client and the service provider trust that the
      enclave provider's enclaves have the security attributes of integrity,
      confidentiality, and attestability.  The client trusts that the enclave
      provider and service provider don't collude.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

We begin with a short, informal overview of our system to provide intuition.
The subsequent sections are going to elaborate on this high-level picture.  

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The service provider implements a new service with the intention of
      running it in an enclave.  Once the implementation is finished, the
      service provider publishes the source code for the clients to audit, and
      runs the code in an enclave.  After booting, the enclave obtains a
      CA-signed certificate.

    \item Users audit the source code.  Once a user has convinced herself that
      the code is free of bugs, she compiles the code using the framework's
      deterministic build system, resulting in an image checksum.

    \item The client establishes an end-to-end encrypted network connection to
      the enclave.  Right \emph{after} establishing the connection but
      \emph{before} revealing any sensitive information, the client provides a
      nonce and asks the enclave for an attestation document.

    \item The enclave receives the nonce and asks its hypervisor to generate an
      attestation document that should contain the client-provided nonce
      \emph{and} the fingerprint of the enclave's CA-signed certificate.  The
      resulting attestation document is returned to the client.

    \item The client performs various checks (see \S~\ref{sec:} for details) and
      trusts the enclave if all checks pass.  The client is then convinced that
      it's communicating with the code that the user audited in the previous
      steps, and is willing to reveal her sensitive information to the enclave.
\end{enumerate}

% As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}, clients submit their IP address
% to the enclave, which is run by the enclave provider but its code comes from
% the service provider.  It's not possible to talk to the enclave directly
% because all communication happens via the (untrustworthy) parent EC2
% instance, which is why we introduce a TCP proxy (run by the infrastructure
% provider), which prevents the EC2 instance from seeing the client's IP
% address.  The client establishes a TLS session that is terminated inside the
% enclave and can therefore be sure that its IP address is sent to the enclave,
% and the enclave only.

% After the enclave received the client's address, it responds with a nonce.
% The enclave does not know if the client reported its real address or a fake
% address, so it must actively verify the address, but it cannot connect to the
% client directly because that would allow the EC2 instance to see the client's
% IP address.  To solve this problem, we make the enclave talk to the client
% via a VPN node.  Upon connection establishment, the client must send the
% nonce it received from the enclave in the previous step.  Once the enclave
% recognizes the nonce, it rests assured that the client really does control
% the IP address it submitted earlier.

% In the final step, the enclave anonymizes the client's IP address and
% forwards it to its back end.

\subsection{The Reproducible Build System}
\label{sec:build-system}

% Why it's not a big deal that only some users can audit our code.
Only a small subset of the users will be skilled enough programmers to audit
the enclave's code for bugs.  We expect non-technical users to trust that other
users---or perhaps professional code audit companies---have studied the code
and pointed out potential bugs.  Once a user has convinced herself of the code's
correctness, she compiles the code to arrive at an image ID.  Crucially, we
need a \emph{deterministic mapping} between the code and its corresponding
image ID because the service provider and clients must agree on the image ID
that's running in the enclave.

Docker does not offer a deterministic mapping because, among other things,
Docker uses timestamps in its build process, causing subsequent builds of
identical code to result in different image IDs.\footnote{In essence, an image
is simply a file system.  If an image is reproducible, separate build processes
arrive at the exact same file system.}  To obtain reproducible builds, we use
the tool kaniko~\cite{kaniko}.  Kaniko's main purpose is to build container
images from a Dockerfile while itself in a container, but we use kaniko because
it can do so reproducibly.  As long as the client and service provider use the
same enclave source code, Go version, and kaniko version, they can build
identical images---even when compiling the code on different platforms, like
Mac OS and Linux.  Equipped with a locally-compiled container image ID, the
client is now ready to interact with the enclave.

\subsection{Framework Features}
\label{sec:framework}

Having established how one can build applications reproducibly, we now turn to
the specific features of our framework.  The following sections discuss how the
framework communicates with the outside world (\S~\ref{sec:networking});
how it seeds its entropy pool, (\S~\ref{sec:entropy});
how it obtains a CA-signed certificate (\S~\ref{sec:cert});
how we facilitate remote attestation (\S~\ref{sec:attestation});
and how enclaves can share their key material to allow for horizontal scaling (\S~\ref{sec:sync});
how we allow for logging (\S~\ref{sec:logging});
and finally how to thwart side-channel attacks (\S~\ref{sec:side-channels}).

\phw{Add subsection on an endpoint that allows for the ingestion of
well-defined, private data (e.g., IP address filter lists).}

\subsubsection{Enabling Networking}
\label{sec:networking}

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:nitro} that Nitro enclaves have no dedicated
network interface and are only able to communicate with their respective EC2
host.  Our framework therefore needs to provide code that runs on the parent
EC2 host and forwards packets between clients and the enclave.
Figure~\ref{fig:networking} illustrates our networking architecture.

When the enclave first starts, it fetches a CA-signed certificate from Let's
Encrypt.  To do so, it first connects to Let's Encrypt's infrastructure via a
SOCKS proxy.  Let's Encrypt does not publish its endpoints' IP addresses, which
is why we cannot use point-to-point connections and have to rely on the
flexibility of a SOCKS proxy.\footnote{We implemented both the SOCKS proxy and
the TCP proxy, and make both available under a free license.}

Clients establish end-to-end encrypted TLS sessions with the enclave via a TCP
proxy on the EC2 machine that translates between AF\_INET and AF\_VSOCK.  Note
that the EC2 machine only sees encrypted data. Clients should further only
connect to the EC2 machine via a third party reverse proxy, which also hides
the client's network identity from the EC2 machine.

In case of a compromise, we don't want the application to be able to leak data
to an attacker-controlled endpoint via the SOCKS proxy, which is why we use an
allow list on the SOCKS proxy.  In a typical application, the allow list
consists of two endpoints:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The domain name acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org to interact with Let's
      Encrypt.
    \item The IP address of whatever back end machine the enclave needs to talk
      to.
\end{enumerate}

  randomness to seed its entropy pool (\ding{202}), followed by initiating an
  ACME session to obtain a Let's Encrypt-signed certificate (\ding{203}), after
  which Let's Encrypt probes the enclave an issues the certificate
  (\ding{204}).  Afterwards, clients can establish HTTPS connections with the
  enclave (\ding{205}) and the enclave can forward data to its back end
  (\ding{206}).  All of the application's ingress and egress  traffic is routed
  over a TCP proxy that translates between AF\_INET and AF\_VSOCK.  Egress
  traffic is reaches the Internet via a SOCKS proxy.}
\label{fig:networking}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Seeding the Entropy Pool}
\label{sec:entropy}

Like virtual machines, a Nitro secure enclave is an entropy-starved, sterile
environment that lacks access to periphery devices that could help the kernel
seed its entropy pool.  To work around that, the Nitro's hypervisor can provide
randomness that the enclave can use to seed its entropy pool.  Our framework
automatically takes advantage of that when it first starts, so application
developers are never going to run into function calls that block because of a
lack of randomness.

\subsubsection{End-to-end Secure Channel}
\label{sec:cert}

Having established how the enclave can send and receive network packets, we now
turn our attention to secure channels.  More specifically: how can a host on
the Internet be sure that it's talking to the enclave application code it
audited, without taking advantage of an existing trust relationship?

We implement a secure channel based on HTTPS.  Once the enclave initialized its
entropy pool, it obtains an HTTPS certificate that allows clients to establish
end-to-end encrypted session with the enclave.  Crucially, the HTTPS
certificate \emph{lives and dies} inside the enclave and its private key cannot
be extracted (or injected) by the service provider.  Our framework allows for
the creation of a self-signed certificate or a CA-signed certificate.  If a
self-signed certificate is desired, the framework creates and signs a
certificate for a given FQDN.  To get a CA-signed certificate, the framework
uses Let's Encrypt's ACME protocol because it allows for the generation of a
certificate with no human interaction.  In that case, the enclave initiates an
HTTP-01 challenge connection with Let's Encrypt's infrastructure via our SOCKS
proxy (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:networking}), and subsequently expects an incoming
connection from Let's Encrypt to port 80, which the hosting EC2 image forwards
to the enclave.  Note that the hosting EC2 machine could also obtain a valid
CA-signed certificate for the same FQDN because the enclave and the EC2 image
share a single IP address.  However, this is of little use to the EC2 machine
as we will discuss in the next section.

The application can register arbitrary handlers.

\phw{Explain why we're not using AWS ACM.}

\subsubsection{Remote Attestation}
\label{sec:attestation}

By default, Nitro Enclaves only allow for local attestation.

we could have also dont it via certificate extension~\cite[\S~3.2]{Knauth2019a}

After the client establishes an HTTPS connection with the enclave, it needs to
know that (\emph{i}) the TLS connection it just established is terminated
inside the enclave (instead of by the EC2 machine) and (\emph{ii}) the enclave
is running the code that the user audited in the previous step.  To that end,
the client requests the enclave's \emph{attestation document}---a
hypervisor-signed document that attests to the container image ID that the
enclave is running.  To request an attestation document, the client provides a
\emph{nonce}---a 20-byte random value---whose purpose is to prevent the service
provider from replaying attestation documents.  Phrased differently, the client
provides a nonce to convince itself that it's talking to an live enclave.  In
particular, clients make the following HTTP request to request an attestation
document:

\begin{lstlisting}
GET /attestation?nonce=80835718840fa8652364e8b5d05a9c03d42123b7 HTTP/1.1
\end{lstlisting}

The enclave receives the request and the provided nonce, asks the hypervisor to
include the nonce \emph{and} the fingerprint of the enclave's X.509 certificate
in the attestation document, and sends the resulting attestation document to
the client.  By asking the hypervisor to include the certificate fingerprint in
the attestation document, we effectively bind a TLS session to an enclave.  The
client then verifies the following in order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The attestation document is signed by the AWS PKI whose public key is
      known to all parties.
    \item The challenge is part of the attestation document.
    \item The fingerprint of the enclave's X.509 certificate is part of the
      attestation document.
    \item The enclave's image ID is identical to the image ID that the client
      compiled locally.
\end{enumerate}

If all four conditions hold, the client is convinced that it's talking to an
enclave that runs the code that the client audited in the previous step, and
that the TLS connection is terminated in the enclave.  Note that the hosting
EC2 machine is able to intercept HTTPS connections with its own, CA-signed
certificate but clients will only trust the EC2 machine if (and only if) it can
produce an attestation document as expected by the client, which it can't.  Now
that the client has established a trust relationship with the enclave, it's
ready to send sensitive information to the enclave.

While attestation documents can be generated quickly and in rapid
succession---we present performance measurements in
Section~\ref{sec:attestation-performance}, they do require an extra round trip
between the client and the enclave before the client is willing to reveal
sensitive information.  To eliminate that round trip, clients should use TLS
session resumption once they have verified the enclave's attestation document.
The service provider is unable to tamper with the enclave's key material, so
it's safe to re-use a once-established TLS session to forego an unnecessary
round trip.

\paragraph{Client-side Verification}

Even for developers, remote attestation is a complex process that is difficult
to understand and work with, and in our setting, end users are expected to
conduct remote attestation.  We therefore made a careful effort to abstract
away technical details.  A user wishing to remotely attest an enclave
essentially asks herself ``Does the enclave that's exposed at a given URL run
the source code that I just audited?''  We built a tool set that reduces the
process to the running of a Makefile, e.g.:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ make verify CODE="/path/to/enclave/code/" \
              ENCLAVE="https://example.com/attest"
\end{lstlisting}

The first environment variable, \texttt{CODE}, points to the directory
containing the source code that the enclave is supposedly running, and the user
audited.  The second variable, \texttt{ENCLAVE}, points to the URL endpoint of
the enclave that the user's client is connecting to.  When the user runs this
command, the Makefile deterministically compiles the given source code to
obtain its image ID, asks the enclave for an attestation document, verifies the
document, and ensures that the attestation document is for the image ID that
was compiled in the first step.  If all checks pass, the tool informs the user
accordingly.

\subsubsection{Sharing Key Material}
\label{sec:sync}

Compare to \cite{Chen2022a}.

Recall that enclaves are essentially sealed black boxes at runtime, preventing
anyone (including Amazon) from extracting key material that was generated
inside the enclave.  While this is a desirable property, it complicates
horizontal scaling.  If a single enclave is unable to handle the service
provider's traffic load, one must scale horizontally, and start new enclaves.
For some use cases, it is not acceptable if each enclave maintains its own key
material.  Instead, it is desirable for enclaves to \emph{share their key
material} to the outside world perceives a set of enclaves as a single machine.

The general idea is that there exists an ``original'' enclave that was started
before any other enclaves. This original enclave must then share its key
material with other enclaves.  Crucially, key material is only shared after
\emph{mutual authentication}.  Key synchronization happens in three steps.

% TODO: Add a diagram that explains the protocol.

\paragraph{First,} once a new enclave is spun up, we instruct the original
enclave to synchronize its key material with the new enclave. We issue an
authenticated request (the exact authentication mechanism is to be determined)
to the enclave, and set the domain name of the new enclave in the request body.

\paragraph{Second,} upon receiving the synchronization request, the original
enclave first asks the new enclave for an attestation document, to convince
itself that it’s sharing its sensitive key material with the same code that the
original enclave is running. Crucially, the original enclave provides a secret
key sk and asks for it to be added to the “user data” field of the attestation
document.

\paragraph{Third,} if the original enclave could verify the new enclave’s
attestation document, it proceeds by sharing its key material. In particular,
the original enclave makes a separate request whose body contains the key
material encrypted with sk, and the original enclave’s attestation document.
The new enclave verifies the original enclave’s attestation document. If the
verification succeeds, it proceeds to use the provided key material.

\subsubsection{Logging}
\label{sec:logging}

\phw{Design a logging mechanism.}

\subsubsection{Thwarting Side-channel Attacks}
\label{sec:side-channels}

The enclave's parent EC2 image cannot see \emph{what} clients submit but it can
see \emph{how much} clients submit and \emph{how long} it takes the enclave to
process data.  The EC2 image can exploit these side channels to learn more
about the client's confidential information and computation.  While such side
channels must be avoided, our framework is not the place to do so.  Instead, it
is the application developer's responsibility to identify and address side
channels.  Section~\ref{sec:applications} introduces three applications and
discusses side channel attacks in their respective setting.

Similarly, programming bugs in the enclave application are also out of scope
for this work.  Memory corruption attacks me be more difficult to implement
against enclave applications\footnote{The untrustworthy operating system (that
may be under the attacker's control) is prohibited by hardware to read the
enclave application's memory or registers in clear text, which forces the
attacker to operate blindly.} but Lee et al. showed that it's possible, by
adapting a return-oriented programming attack against SGX~\cite{Lee2017a}.
