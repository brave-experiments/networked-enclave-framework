\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work presents \tool{}, a tool kit that facilitates development of
fast, networked, enclaves.  \Tool{} builds on top of AWS Nitro enclaves whose
architecture is designed to be resistant to the type of side channel attacks
that have plagued SGX et al. for years.  Our performance evaluation suggests
that \tool{} can handle low-latency and high-throughput applications like HD
video calls and our prototypes show that \tool{} is practical, integrates well
into popular development workflows, and enables new use cases for networked
enclaves.
