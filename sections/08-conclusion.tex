\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work presents \tool{}, a tool kit that facilitates the rapid development of
flexible, powerful, and secure enclaves.  By building \tool{} on top of AWS
Nitro Enclaves, we inherit their strong security properties; and we carefully
engineered \tool{} to provide seamless and secure networking, scalability, and
remote attestation while remaining entirely user-verifiable.

Our performance evaluation and our
three prototypes suggest that \tool{} can handle low-latency, high-throughput,
and computationally demanding applications like watching HD video streams in an
in-enclave Chromium browser.
