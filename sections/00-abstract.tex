In 2020, Amazon introduced Nitro enclaves---cloud-based secure enclaves that do
not share hardware with untrustworthy code, therefore promising resistance
against side channel attacks, which have plagued Intel's SGX for years.  While
their security properties are attractive, Nitro enclaves are difficult to
write code for and are not meant to be used as a networked service, which
greatly limits their potential.
%
In this paper, we built a framework that allows for convenient and flexible use
of Nitro enclaves by abstracting away complex aspects like remote attestation
and end-to-end encryption between an enclave and a remote client.
%
We demonstrate the practicality of our framework by designing and implementing
two production-grade systems that solve real-world problems: remotely verifiable
IP address pseudonymization and private telemetry.
%
Our practical experience suggests that our framework enables quick prototyping,
is flexible enough to accommodate different use cases, and inherits strong
security and performance properties from the underlying Nitro enclaves.
