\begin{abstract}

In 2020, Amazon introduced Nitro enclaves---cloud-based secure enclaves that do
not share hardware with untrustworthy code, promising resistance against side
channel attacks, which have plagued Intel's SGX for years.  While their security
properties are attractive, Nitro enclaves are difficult to use and not meant to
be used as a networked service, which greatly limits their potential.
%
We built a framework that allows for convenient and flexible use of Nitro
enclaves.  We abstract away complex aspects like remote attestation and
end-to-end encryption, and implement a library that allows for easier to use,
secure enclaves.
%
To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we design and implement two
production-grade systems on top of our framework: for user-verifiable IP address
pseudonymization and for private telemetry.
%
We find that our framework enables quick prototyping, is flexible enough to
accommodate different use cases, different use cases, and inherits strong
security and performance properties from the underlying Nitro enclaves.
