\begin{abstract}

Amazon recently introduced cloud-based secure-computing enclaves as part of
  their Nitro virtual machine architecture.  These
enclaves do not share hardware with untrustworthy code, promising resistance
against the side channel attacks which have plagued Intel's SGX for years.  While
the security properties are attractive, Nitro enclaves are
not meant to be used as a networked service, which greatly limits their
potential.
%
We build a framework that allows for convenient and flexible use of Nitro
enclaves for networked services.  We abstract away complex aspects like remote attestation and
end-to-end encryption, and implement a library that simplies use.
%
To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we design and implement two
production-grade systems on top of our framework: for IP address
pseudonymization and private telemetry.
%
We find that our framework enables quick prototyping, adapts to
different use cases, and inherits strong security and performance properties
from the underlying Nitro enclaves.
