\begin{abstract}

Amazon recently introduced cloud-based enclaves---called Nitro enclaves.  These
enclaves do not share hardware with untrustworthy code, promising resistance
against side channel attacks, which have plagued Intel's SGX for years.  While
the security properties are attractive, Nitro enclaves are difficult to use and
not meant to be used as a networked service, which greatly limits their
potential.
%
We build a framework that allows for convenient and flexible use of secure
enclaves.  We abstract away complex aspects like remote attestation and
end-to-end encryption and implement a library that allows for simpler, secure
enclaves.
%
To demonstrate the practicality of our framework, we design and implement two
production-grade systems on top of our framework; for IP address
pseudonymization and private telemetry.
%
We find that our framework enables quick prototyping, can be adapted to
different use cases, and inherits strong security and performance properties
from its underlying technology, Nitro Enclaves.
