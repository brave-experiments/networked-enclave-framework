Secure enclaves are powerful but difficult to use, and a lot can go wrong.

In this paper, we build a framework that allows for easier use of secure enclaves.  We abstract away complex aspects like remote attestation and end-to-end encryption and implement a library that allows for simpler secure enclaves.  We then evaluate our framework on $n$ user cases.
